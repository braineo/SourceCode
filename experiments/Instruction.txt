1. calcMainAllSubject20130430.m read sample database and random pick sample based on picture unit
2. calcMainAllSubject20130514.m read sample database and true random sampling. Training set and test set is fixed, algorithm save lots of memory but it was very slow
3. calcMainAllSubject20130520.m almost the same with No.2 but much faster by using more than 14GB memory, care when run it.
4. calcMainAllSubject20130613.m For every test subject, use all samples without random sampling, cost over 3800 sec for each person, depend on your PC spec.
5. calcMainAllSubject20130617.m For every test subject, use all samples without random sampling, using face fixations while not considering the weight of face
